# Machine Learning Research Notes

This is where I will be writing my personal notes on mathematics behind Machine Learning and reviews of ML research papers. \

## Who am I and why am I doing this?

Hi, I am a university student involved in AI research. I plan to get familiar with the mathematical concepts behind ML and also keep myself up-to-speed with the ML landscape by reading up on at least one paper every week. \
Do expect my notes to be easy-to-digest and I'll make sure to cover as much theoretical aspects of ML.
One day, I hope to have my own research paper be included in this repository!

## My Interests

My interests in ML span areas such as:
* Machine Learning Architecture
* Deep RL
* LLMs
* Computer Vision
* ... and more!
