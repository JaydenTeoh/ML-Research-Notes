## Who am I and why am I doing this?

Hi, I am a undergraduate actively engaged in AI research! \
I have a keen interest in the mathematical concepts behind machine learning and staying up-to-date with the ML landscape by regularly reading ML papers. \
As someone relatively new to ML, I often encounter complex theories or technicalities that can be overwhelming. I hope my notes can serve as a helpful resource for fellow beginners in the field of ML, just like me.

## My Interests

My interests in ML span areas such as:
* Machine Learning Architecture
* Deep RL
* LLMs
* Computer Vision
* ... and more!
