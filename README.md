# Machine Learning Research Papers Notes

This is where I will be writing my personal notes of prominent ML research papers.

## Who am I and why am I doing this?

I am a university student involved in AI research. I plan to keep myself up-to-speed with the ML landscape by reading up on at least one paper every week. 
As I am still an undergraduate, do expect my notes to be easy-to-digest and I'll make sure to cover as much theory as well as technical aspects of papers.
One day, I hope to have my own research paper be included in this repository!
